      use your own package manager command with sudo privilige to install dosbox
      like:
    </p>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="code" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">
        <strong>sudo zypper in dosbox</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">
      while <strong>sudo</strong> ask for sudo privilige which is required in
      most of the occasions. <strong>zypper</strong> is the package manager name
      for openSUSE(a linux version made by German). <strong>in</strong> means
      install for zypper and <strong>dosbox</strong> is the package name. Notice
      sometimes the package name is different from its usual software name so
      the best way before the installation of a package is to search the
      software’s package name in different distributions. You can search it in
      any engines you like or use command like this:
    </p>
    <p class="container" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">
      <strong class="code">sudo zypper search dosbox</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">
      It returns a chart including all packages whose name includes dosbox such
      as dosbox-sid and uninsdosboxoio-siodi.

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">
      You could run dosbox by clicking its icon in the search bar or application
      bar but more efficiently you could directly type
      <strong>dosbox</strong> in the bash and the window will show up. Focus on
      the dosbox’s command line, it may start with <strong>Z:&gt;</strong>, or
      anything else. You may need to redirect the directory to somewhere on your
      computer to make dosbox be able to use files you made. Command is :
    </p>
    <p class="container" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">
      <strong class="code">mount c ~/pathOne/pathTwo</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">
      Here c is the symbol. Best choice is c.
      <a style="font-family: mono_andale">~/pathOne/pathTwo</a> is the directory
      name. Here ~ represents /home/yourUserName. You could input absolute path
      too which is recommended.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">
      To use a new shell system, first type Help or HELP or anything else to ask
      for directions. You could learn some basic use in dosbox through doing so
      like dir to list all files and directories and cd to switch directories.
      Or you could search mannual or tutorials online for help.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">
      Now if you input the command above (<strong
        style="font-family: mono_andale"
        >mount c ~/pathOne/pathTwo</strong
      >) , you see nothing happened, if its
      <strong style="font-family: mono_andale">Z:&gt;</strong> before, it still
      didnt change. Du~de, we need one more step. Remember we use
      <strong style="font-family: mono_andale">c</strong> after mount. We may
      type command below in the dosbox shell:
    </p>
    <p class="container" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">
      <strong class="code">c:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">
      and after this you would see the letter finally changed. dir it and you
      could see the files in your input directory be listed below.

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">
      Dosbox actually is a simulator for a specific environment which means the
      dosbox file system could be very different from your linux file system.
      For example .exe file can’t directly be executed in linux while it can be
      done in dosbox.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">
      We did set a path on our computer for dosbox to use earlier. The directory
      we set for dosbox is a platform where dosbox can read files and do its own
      stuff. Since .exe files can’t be excuted by linux but can be executed in
      dosbox, we put .exe files in the directory we set for dosbox. And type the
      name of the .exe file, we can see it be run or executed in dosbox.

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="34">
      But we need dosbox just for enviroment simulation. What should we do if we
      need to assemble .asm files?
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">
      Well you could use nasm in linux which is recommended. Just install nasm
      using command we use to install dosbox above, don’t need to search, the
      package name is nasm itself.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">
      But some people would still need masm. If we need to assemble .asm in
      Intel 80 86 chips (8086,8088,80286,80386,80486 and pentium. These chips
      have some differences on the CPU registers’ bits number and names. Further
      information may require an assembly language tutorial book) environment,
      we need masm to do this step.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">
      What’s masm? masm is a .exe file with a full name Microsoft Macro
      Assembler from where we can see why it’s .exe file. How to use masm in
      linux? Like what we analyzed, we need to move masm.exe in the directory we
      set for dosbox, type masm and let dosbox execute the masm.exe file.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">
      Well we did it! One more stuff is that assembling .asm files not only
      needs masm, but also needs many other tools which are all .exe files. We
      obey the same way we do for masm.exe. And the directory we set for dosbox
      can now be called as an assemble enviroment. If we wanna do any assembling
      work, make .asm files in pure text format in that directory and use
      tools(masm and etc) in the dosbox shell, we will get the result. The
      normal procedure to use these tools are: masm fileName, link fileName,
      fileName.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">
      For example we created and wrote sample.asm in the directory we set for
      dosbox. Now we do:
    </p>
    <p class="container" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46">
      <strong class="code">masm sample;</strong> make sample.obj file
    </p>
    <p class="container" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">
      <strong class="code">link sample;</strong> make sample.exe file through
      sample.obj
    </p>
    <p class="container" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">
      <strong class="code">sample</strong> execute sample.exe like execute
      masm.exe by just typing masm
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="51" data-line-end="52">
      We will see the result be displayed on the dosbox (0,0,0) screen with
      (255,255,255) frontface color. Notice ; at the end of masm and link
      command means jumping all other questions.

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="54" data-line-end="55">
      Well now we need only the tools’ files, of course .exe type. You can
      download them online using all the ways. Here are these tools provided in
      the
